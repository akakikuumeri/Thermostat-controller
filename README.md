# Thermostat-controller
A friend's home has two thermostat with separate wall-mounted control panels. This device measures the room temperature independently and uses a PID controller to achieve the desired temperature. A wireless RF link is used to command sub-modules to electronically "push" the buttons on the old remote controllers via some optoisolators.
